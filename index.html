			<p> <h2>Title: Our Journey of 7 and 17</h2>

				In 2019's first year, destiny brought us close,
				Yet silent we remained, the unspoken prose.
				This year, fate's hand intervened once more,
				A new chapter unfolding, an unlocked door.
				
				We hesitated, with caution, we took a chance,
				Fearful of love's dance, a fragile romance.
				But on Valentine's, the spark ignited bright,
				Two hearts intertwined, taking flight.
				
				In March, intimacy like a gentle breeze,
				Our souls entwined, our worries put at ease.
				April to May, a rocky road we faced,
				Yet, in your eyes, my home, my safe place.
				
				Then May came, a new journey's start,
				You ventured afar, though not from my heart.
				Traveling, working, a world unknown,
				In spirit, together, never truly alone.
				
				Your favorite numbers, 7 and 17, our guiding star,
				Symbolic of love, our connection from afar.
				As June passes by, I'm inspired to say,
				Today, my love, I want us official in every way.
				
				In the beauty of 7 and 17, our love does bloom,
				A tapestry woven, a shared destiny's loom.
				Through ups and downs, we've grown strong,
				And now, my love, to you, I belong.
				
				So here and now, on this June 17th,
				With heartfelt words, my love I present.
				Let's make this journey official and true,
				With you by my side, there's nothing we can't do.
				
				Together we'll face life's joys and sorrows,
				With love as our shield, we'll conquer tomorrows.
				No distance or time can keep us apart,
				For you, my love, have captured my heart.
				
				Today, I ask, with love so pure,
				Will you be my girlfriend, my love, my cure?
				With you, my dear, I'm forever blessed,
				In the tapestry of love, together we'll rest.
				
				With all my heart and soul, I pray,
				You'll say yes and join me on this pathway.
				Our journey of 7 and 17, intertwined,
				Hand in hand, our love redefined.</p>
			<p>Memory lane: I need to add picutres here but I dont have time is poem to a very long while.</p>
			<p>Shared interests: I plan to update this page for our aniversaries. </p>
			<p>Future plans: I want to make a feature were we can both update this page but that will take a long time to figure out as I would make an account and everything
				but for now I will just add these as time goes along
			</p>
			<p>So this is kinda incompelte babes. This whole work thing slowed down my plans but its the 17th day of the 7 month so I figured now 
				would be the best time to tell you.
