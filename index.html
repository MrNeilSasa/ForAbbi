			<p>It's a shame your heart had to be broken for me to find you, but I'm glad it was because now I have the nicest, finest, sexiest, loveliest woman in the world, and she makes me one of the luckiest guys on earth.</p>

			<p>Being with you is like a breath of fresh air, filling my days with happiness. Whenever you're around, I just want to kiss you. I can't keep my hands off you. I'm becoming more and more obsessed with you in a healthy way and the good kind of obsessed.

			<p>Your smile is like sunshine, radiating warmth and joy. That smile belongs to me, your heart belongs to me, you belong to me, and all of me belongs to you.

			<p>Your love is a melody that plays endlessly in my heart. I know you love me deeply and you're a bit hesitant to make me understand how much you care, but I'll gain your trust if it's the last thing I do in life.

			<p>Your laughter is music to my ears, bringing joy to every moment we share. I'd rather have you laughing and smiling than confusing you and making you upset. I mean, just look at that smileâ€”it's perfect.
